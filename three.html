        <h1>Chapter <span>Three</span> Summary</h1>

        <div class="content">


            <p>
                In the chapter three of the book, Ummi tells a story of Talle who is described as the quiet one in the
                book. He lived in a small community called Lafayette.
            </p>

            <p>
                Talle was given birth after many years of childlessness and his birth caused the death of her mother. He
                grew up leaving quiet and reserved life. His silent life was also caused by the death if his father and
                step mother. He was barely twenty (20) years old when he lost both his father and stepmother in a car
                accident.
            </p>

            <p>
                At this point, he feels disappointed in life and helpless and that is exactly why she was described as
                the quiet one.

                Talle managed a job as a driver in a local government office and still maintained his decent and quiet
                life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Due to her quiet lifestyle, he is considered a good person who can never or hardly do anything to harm
                anyone. In fact, he was seen as an epitome of goodness in a human.
            </p>

            <p>
                At a point, Talle needed some money and confides in a friend of his called Zaki. Zaki suggests that they
                embark on abduction mission. He said they should abduct a rich man’s child and ask for ransom. In that
                way, they will make so much money to solve their problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both parties carried out their plan by kidnapping the son of a rich man. Talle held the child in custody
                for one week as both demanded a ransom of one million naira (₦1,000,000). They later reduced their
                demands to one hundred and fifty thousand naira (₦150,000)
            </p>

            <p>
                Talle goes to the market to buy some stuffs for himself. The market price of goods have risen
                drastically but he still demands that those things be given to him. The market women notices a chance in
                the quantity of goods he ordered. In their minds, they asked questions like: how could Talle who comes
                to the market to beg now turn to demand higher quantity of goods even at higher prices?
            </p>

            <p>
                This causes the market women to report the issue to the District Head (also called Hakimi in their local
                dialect). While the District Head interrogates Talle, the police arrives at the place and arrests Talle.
                Both Talle and Zaki were accused of kidnapping (abduction), robbery and extortion.
                They were later sentenced to imprisonment for years.
            </p>

            <p>
                Drawing from this chapter, one of the most trusted persons in the community turns a thug and does what
                nobody expects. This also shows that people change.
