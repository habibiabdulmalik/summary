                Salma confides in Tomiwa, her roommate, expressing how she thinks talking to Labaran could help could
                help solve her problem by talking to Habib.

                She felt helpless when she learned that Dr, Dabo whom she insulted in her 100L is the only one who could
                help her out. For this reason, she resorted to Habib to give her some money to give to offer to the
                Chairman of Examination and Ethics Committee (EMEC). Salma describes the EMEC Chairman as one who could
                sell his motherâ€™s soul for money.
            </p>

                Habib agrees to give her the money but in turn requests that Salma pays back in kind which Salma
                reluctantly does. Habib, the rich politician gives Salma a hundred thousand naira to help sort herself
                out.
            </p>

                Salma gets ready to meed the Chairman of EMEC in a hotel. When she got to the hotel, she met one Dr.
                Kabir and gave the money. Unknowingly to her, Dr. Kabir is not the Chairman of EMEC instead, he is just
                a laboratory technologist employed by the University. Salma was pained to the core because she has
                missed an opportunity of sorting her problems.
