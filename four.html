        <h1>Chapter <span>FOUR</span> Summary</h1>

                This chapter starts with an opening paragraph of Salma who came for her registration and doubtless in prime
                of her youth.
                Salma comes across Doctor Dabo, a highly disciplined lecturer who does not take any nonsense from anybody.
                Most of the students respected him due to his high level of discipline. His rule was that students are not
                allowed to come into the lecture room before him.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Salma goes into Dr Dabo’s office, the highly disciplined lecturer. Dr. Dabo loses control and acts
                erotically towards Salma. Salma on her own part arrogantly dismisses him and insulted him before leaving the
                office. Dr. Dabo was lost in shame and confusion as he thought of a way of maintaining his personality.

                Salma completes her registration and joins three other girls in a room who were already occupying there
                together before her arrival. She was meant to live with them in that room (hostel) as they were all
                students. At first, Salma was uncomfortable with the idea of living with the three of them because the
                hostel was not beautiful and the ladies were not sophisticated ladies or happening babes like her. Simply
                put, one thing Salma hated about her roommates was the composition of her roommates.

            <p>
                These are the names of Salma’s roommates: Tomiwa, Ngozi and Ada. Tomiwa is from the West specifically from
                Ibadan, Ngozi is from Umunze in Imo State, Ada is from Benue State or Middle Belt while Salma is from the
                North.
    
                Salma and Tomiwa were Muslims while Ada and Ngozi were Christians.
    
                Salma and her roommate never really fought rather they stayed together as sisters.

                One evening, Salma meets Habib, a rich politician and his driver, Labaran. They offered her a ride on a
                Mercedes Benz. Salma already decided to turn down Habibs proposal of he eventually does seeing that it is
                dangerous. Salma finally turns down his proposal as the political mugul proposed to her.

                Before Salma left, Habib bought lots of gifts for her and gave her huge amount of money too which she went
                home with.
