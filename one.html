                This was the story, Bint’s Teacher (Mallam Salihu) asked the class how to say Good morning in French.
                The
                class
                was silent until Bint answered that Good morning in french is Bonjour. Bint then asked the teacher, how
                do
                we
                say very good in French? The Teacher could not answer.
            </p>


            <p>
                To ensure he doesn’t mislead the pupils, Mallam Salihu went out to call the French teacher who answered
                the
                question; C’est tres bien means very good in French. Bint looked at the French teacher who answered the
                Question
                in admiration.

                The Pupils surround Bint and started clapping and singing going around her because she asked a question
                the
                teacher could not answer.
                The mom then entered the room to join them and the conversation got animated (Full of life, exciting,
                lively).
                Ummi claimed that it was better for the teacher to call someone else than to give the wrong answer.
                However,
                Bint didn’t agree. According to Bint, the teaching claims he knows too much.

                Ummi then said, what if the teacher had told you that au revoir means very good? Meanwhile, it is how to
                say
                goodbye until we meet again in French?
                While they were still gisting, Omar came in to break the news that he has been given admission to study
                Study
                Law at the Kongo Campus of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.
            </p>

            <p>
                The mom was very happy about the admission and also considering the fact that Omar’s dad had the dream
                to
                study
                Law but didn’t work out. Ummi then told Omar that Admission is THE LIFE CHANGER. That is where the name
                of
                the
                Novel The Life changer by Khadija Abubakar Jalli was gotten.
