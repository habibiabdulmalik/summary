                Doctor was Kabir’s nickname given to him since his secondary school days and he still retains the name. When he was finally employed in Salma’s university as a Laboratory Technologist he got closer to lecturers due to his friendliness and jovial lifestyle.

                Salma shares her pains with Labaran, telling him how he was scammed by Dr. Kabir. Labaran suggests to Habib to involve Zaki in the matter so he can attack Kabir and recover the money. Habib remembers how Zaki messed up his last task when he was hired to kidnap Alhaji Adamu’s first son. This simply means that Habib had a hand in the abduction of Alhaji Adamu’s child as they were later exposed and sentenced to imprisonment.
                Habib reluctantly calls Zaki and gives him the job, to attack and recover the money from Dr. Kabi.
