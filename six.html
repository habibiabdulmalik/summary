                Despite the fact that the four girls were into men, they were at the top of the academic game. They
                never allowed their academic lives to crumble as they all did well.

                Salma finds Moral Philosophy very hard. She, like other students does not attend Moral Philosophy
                lectures. The lecturer in charge repeats question with little changes. For this reason, she thought of
                only on method to adopt while reading – study past questions for that course.
            </p>

            <p>
                She studies all night in preparation for her final examination the next day. She studies past questions
                and answers and even tries cram some parts of the book.
                Moral Philosophy was a GST course in Salama’s school.

                Unfortunately, Salma could not write anything in the examination because none of what she studied came
                out. She was afraid of failing considering that she faces her final paper in the University.
            </p>

                Salma resorts to Kola, her seatmate (his full name is Kolawole Abdul). Kola is a brilliant guy who can
                seat and write on his own confidently. He resisted Salma at first but decides to give in later. Salma
                seeks help from Kola which he offered by giving her a salvation note (expo) to enable her write her
                examination.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately for both students (Salma and Kola), a lecturer catches them in the act and mandates them
                to fill the Examination Malpractice (EMAL) form.
            </p>

            <p>
                They were arraigned before the Examination Ethics Committee (EMEC) for questioning. At the end, both
                were found guilty of examination malpractice and expelled in their 400 level (the final class).
            </p>

            <p>
                Both parties misses their final paper which would have made them university graduates.
