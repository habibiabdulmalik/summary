                ummi was from the community of lafayette. she gained admission to study in the university.Ummi’s
                father and her husband contracted the marriage before ummi would go for her registration in the
                university.
            </p>

            <p>
                ummi’s first shock in the university was the carefree attitudes of the student and the fact
                that everybody wore casual wears so it was difficult to tell the difference between lecturers and
                students
            </p>

            <p>
                she went further to tell Omar that law students were an exception wearing white shirts and black
                trouser, then she asked not to be interfered.
            </p>

                Salma was a fair complexioned girl,tall slim and bursty.Salma’s tight dress and sunshades made her
                appearance formidable.

                ummi’s first experience with salma was at the registration office.

                salma was last and barely 15mins on the queue. out of fraustration she started grumbling about how
                heartless the lecturers in the university can be.
            </p>

            <p>
                salma engaged in a conversation with a young man(lecturer) where she told him how policeman
                were better than lecturers. she claimed that to get easy access to anything you need to pay.The guys you
                bring money the ladies you date them.

                John was the man cleaning the registration office.
            </p>

            <p>
                Salma went to the departmental office where she met the HOD MR Samuel Johnson. He was very young,had
                tribal marks(signifying ancestral betrayal) and a Yoruba person.

                MR samuel johnson issued the Matric number :UGoo1 to Ummi.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ummi’s general experience in the departmental offfice was terrible, bringing back memories of Salma’s
                experience.

                She hated three things;the fact that the HOD called her dear,his admiration towards her attire and
                finally the comment “You are better than i imagined” which made her use the Toilet excuse.
            </p>

            <p>
                Salma finished all her registration by 4 o’clock, where she entered a tricycle(keke na pep) and went
                home to prepare a meal for her Husband(was not back from work at the moment)

                Mr Samuel Johnson is a friend of Ummi’s husband and helped him in ummi’s admission.
            </p>
