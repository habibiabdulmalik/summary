                Tomiwa was to go on her first ever blind date which was setup by salma.
                She received a call by 8 o’clock which she has been expecting.

                Tomawi according to writer Never had a date because her character screamed over-confidence leading to
                everyone body viewing her as out of league.
                Tomiwa’s reason for switching seat was to ensure her safety.

                Habib was Tomiwa’s blind date.
            </p>

                Habib and labaran were friends from a little age. Habib was a politician while labaran was his driver.

                The sum total of the cash Habib gave to tomiwa is N50,000(he didn’t want labaran to see this), together
                with other provisions.
                Alhaji was the name tomiwa called Habib after his kind gesture.

                Tomiwa and her friends were all excited about the goodies she brought and in the midst of the
                celebration Ngozi closed the door to avoid intruders.
                Salma at first was waiting to be thanked for introducing Tomiwa to Habib until the moment she saw the
                money, then she became envious.
            </p>

            <p>
                Salma’s envy led to her lashing at the three other roommates until they heard a knock, which at the
                moment made them silent leading to Ada switching off the lights.
                No man spends his money without asking for something in return was Ngozi’s statement to Tomiwa.

                The four roommates Salma, Ngozi, Ada and tomiwa were all B students and were certain to graduated second
                class upper.
                Their final paper was Moral philosophy, which was a general study.
