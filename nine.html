        <p>
            In this chapter, Ummi narrates Salim’s experience with a mystery girl whom he met on one of the social media
            platforms. Salim is Salma’s fiancé.
        </p>

            This chapter opens as Salim tells Lawal of his experience with Natasha, a mystery girl whom he met on social
            media. After exchanging contacts, pictures and affection Salim prepares to visit Natasha according to her
            preferences.
        </p>

        <p>
            Salim travels late in the evening around 9:00 PM to meet Natasha since Natasha told him that she is not
            allowed to come out during the day.
            While Salim was returning, Natasha joins him in front of his SUV (Salim’s car). Salim was caught by
            Natasha’s beauty. All of a sudden, some robbers attempt to rob him which he narrowly escaped. Natasha was
            used by the thugs as a trap to catch and rob Salim.
        </p>

        <p>
            Salim meets another girl on social media whom he sees to be beautiful. He requests that Lawal goes with him
            to avoid any form of attack on his way but Lawal did not grant such request.
        </p>

        <p>
            Salim proceeds with his plan to visit the new girl. He returns with disappointment as the girl he met looks
            different from the girl he saw on social media; the girl was ugly.
